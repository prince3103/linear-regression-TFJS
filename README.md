# Linear Regression

This is a linear regression model built using TensorFlow.js.

## Description

This model trains at runtime according to the data points drawn on canvas, optimizes slope and y-intercept (by minimizing the MSE Loss function using Stochastic Gradient Descent with a Learning Rate of 0.2) to get a best fitting line for the data points drawn on canvas.
